  2. Two way Data Binding: 
     In angular , it is possible to send the data from HTML to TS or TS to HTML of a component at a time.
     To achieve this we need to use "ngModel" to implement two way data binding. ngModel is available in formsModule.

     step 1: import formsModule since it has ngModel in app.module.ts
     also write it in imports
     //app.module.ts
     import {formsModule} from '@angular/forms'
     imports: [formsModule]
     
     //app.component.ts
     export class AppComponent{
      data:string=''
     }

     //app.component.html
     <input placeholder="enter text" type="text" [(ngModel)]="data" />
